Multi containers example.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

The application starts a docker-in-docker instance and runs docker-compose.
docker-compose then builds and runs the containers.

You can edit docker-compose.yml to add the containers you need.

For docker in docker, check [jpetazzo/dind](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind).
